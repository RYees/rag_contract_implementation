# Legal Contract Analyser
In today's fast-paced business environment, the review and analysis of legal contracts can be a time-consuming and complex task. To address this challenge, a cutting-edge contract analysis chatbot is developed that leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.

The contract analysis chatbot is designed to empower users in the process of reviewing and understanding their legal contracts. By harnessing the capabilities of RAG, the chatbot can engage in natural language conversations with users, allowing them to ask questions, raise concerns, and gain insights about the key terms and provisions within their contracts.
